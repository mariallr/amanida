\description{
\code{amanida_vote} performs vote-counting on qualitative data.
}
\details{
Vote-counting is computed without trend division. Punctuation of entries is based on trend, up-regulation gives 1, down-regulation give -1 and equal behavior gives 0. Total sum is divided then by the total number of entries on each compound.

Note that \code{amanida_vote} skips rows with missing values or NA.

Formats compatible are csv, xlsx, xls or txt.
