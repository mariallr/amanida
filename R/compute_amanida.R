#' Combine statistical results and compute vote-counting
#' 
#' \code{compute_amanida} Combines for the same entry or metabolite the statistical values of p-value and fold-change. Also is computed a vote-counting for each compound. 
#' 
#' Entries corresponding to metabolites are divided by trend and then combined as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item P-values are combined using Fisher method weighted by N and chi-squared distribution
#'  \item Fold-change are combined by weighted mean
#' }
#' 
#' Vote-counting is computed without trend division. Punctuation of entries is based on trend, up-regulation gives 1, down-regulation give -1 and equal behavior gives 0. Total sum is divided then by the total number of entries on each compound.
#'   
#' @param datafile data imported using amanida_read function
#' @return METAtable S4 object with p-value combined, fold-change combined and vote-counting for each compound
