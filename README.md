# amanida: a R package for adapted meta-analysis with non-integral data

## Description

`Amanida` package contains a collection of functions for computing an adapted meta-analysis in R only using significance and effect size. It covers the lack of data provided on metabolomic studies, where is rare to have error or variance disclosed. With this adaptation, only using p-value and fold-change, global significance and effect size for compounds or metabolites are obtained. 

Furthermore, `Amanida` also computes semi-quantitative meta-analysis performing a vote-counting for compounds. 


## Documentation

The following computations are included:

* Trend division: values are divided in tables to mantain the trend, up-regulated (fold-change > 1) and down-regulated (fold-change < 1).
* P-value combination: Fisher's method weigthed by number of participants on the study. 
* Fold-change combination: logarithmic transformation for average with weigthing by number of participants. 
* Compound vote-counting: votes are +1 for up-regulation, -1 for down-regulation and 0 if no trend. The total votes are divided by the number of reports. 

The following plots are included to visualize the results: 

* Volcano plot of meta-analysis results: showing compounds labels for over the selected cut-off. 
* Bar plot of vote-counting results.
* Bar plot of reports divided by trend including the total vote-counting.

## Installation

#### Beta/Github release:

Installation using R package devtools:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mariallr/amanida")
```

#### CRAN:

```r
install.packages("amanida")
```

## Usage

You can use `Amanida` package in RStudio or R. After installation (explained before) follow this steps: 

**1. Load package in your script:**

```r
library(amanida)
```

**2. Read your data: `amanida_read`**

Supported files are csv, xls/xlsx and txt. The file need in this order the following columns:
* Id: compound name or unique identification
* P-value
* Fold-change
* N: number of individuals in the study
* Reference: bibliographic reference of the results

```r
coln = c("Compound Name", "P-value", "Fold-change", "N total", "References")
input_file <- system.file("extdata", "dataset2.csv", package = "amanida")
datafile <- amanida_read(input_file, coln, separator=";")
```

**3. Perform adapted meta-analysis: `compute_amanida`**

```r
amanida_result <- compute_amanida(datafile)
```

In this step you will obtain an S4 object with two tables:

* adapted meta-analysis acces by `amanida_result@stat`
* vote-counting acces by `amanida_results@vote`


#### Plots

**Graphical visualization for adapted meta-analysis results: `volcano_plot`**

```r
volcano_plot(amanida_result, cutoff = c(0.05,4))
```

**Graphical visualization of compounds vote-counting: `vote_plot`**

```r
vote_plot(amanida_result)
```

**Graphical visualization of compounds vote-counting and reports divided trend: `explore_plot`**

```r
explore_plot(sample_data)
```


## Examples

There is an example dataset installed, to run examples please load:

```r
data("sample_data")
```

The dataset consits in a short list of compounds extracted from *Comprehensive volatilome and metabolome signatures of colorectal cancer in urine: A systematic review and meta-analysis.* MallafrÃ© et al. 2021 Article in revision.
