## Description

`Amanida` package contains a collection of functions for computing an adapted meta-analysis in R only using significance and effect size. It covers the lack of data provided on metabolomic studies, where is rare to have error or variance disclosed. With this adaptation, only using p-value and fold-change, global significance and effect size for compounds or metabolites are obtained. 

Furthermore, `Amanida` also computes semi-quantitative meta-analysis performing a vote-counting for compounds. 


## Documentation

The following computations are included:

* Trend division: values are divided in tables to mantain the trend, up-regulated (fold-change > 1) and down-regulated (fold-change < 1).
* P-value combination: Fisher's method weigthed by number of participants on the study. 
* Fold-change combination: logarithmic transformation for average with weighting by number of participants. 
* Compound vote-counting: votes are +1 for up-regulation, -1 for down-regulation and 0 if no trend. The total votes are divided by the number of reports. 

The following plots are included to visualize the results: 

* Volcano plot of meta-analysis results: showing compounds labels for over the selected cut-off. 
* Bar plot of compound abundance

## Installation

### Beta/Github release:

Installation using R package devtools:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mariallr/amanida")
```

### CRAN:

```r
install.packages("amanida")
```

## Examples

There is an example dataset installed, to run examples please load:

```r
data("sample_data")
```

The dataset consits in a short list of compounds extracted from *Comprehensive signature of colorectal cancer volatilome and metabolome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.* MallafrÃ© et al. 2021 Article in revision
