## Data exploration

Data is loaded using `amanida_read` function:

```{r, eval = F}
coln = c("Compound Name", "Behaviour", "References")
input_file <- system.file("extdata", "dataset2.csv", package = "amanida")
datafile <- amanida_read(input_file, mode = "qual", coln, separator=";")
```

Your data:

```{r, echo = F}
datafile <- amanida_read(params$file_name, params$analysis_type, params$column_id, params$separator) 
```

Here are shown 10 random rows:

```{r, echo = F}
data_imp <- datafile %>% 
  mutate(trend = case_when(trend == -1 ~ "Down-regulated",
                           T ~ "Up-regulated")) %>%
  rename("ID" = id,
         "Reference" = ref,
         "Behaviour" = trend) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 10)

kbl(data_imp, 
      booktabs = T, 
      caption = "Table 1: Data exploration",
    align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("basic", "scale_down")) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

## Qualitative analysis

Qualitative analysis is performed by the vote-counting computed as follows: for compounds up-regulated are count as +1 and for down-regulated as -1. Total sum is obtained for each compound. 

```{r, eval = T}
vote_results <- amanida_vote(datafile)
```

```{r, eval = F}
vote_results@vote
```

```{r, echo = F}
kbl(vote_results@vote %>%
      arrange(desc(abs(votes))) %>% 
      select(id, votes, articles) %>%
      rename("ID" = id,
        "Votes" = votes,
         "Articles reporting" = articles), 
      booktabs = T, 
      caption = "Table 3: Qualitative analysis",
    align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("basic", "scale_down")) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px") 
```

Qualitative results can be also graphically inspected without trend division. Here the vote_plot is set to show the identifiers with a minimum of a vote-counting of `r params$votecount_lim`

```{r, out.width= '100%', echo = T}
vote_plot(vote_results, counts = params$votecount_lim)
```

Here, the explore_plot will only display the relevant identifiers (elements bigger than 2 votes) or those with discrepancies between studies. 

As dataset is big, on the following plot will be only displayed elements bigger than `r params$votecount_lim` votes and the elements with discrepancies between studies:

```{r pressure, echo=T, message=TRUE}
explore_plot(datafile, type = "mix", params$votecount_lim)
```
